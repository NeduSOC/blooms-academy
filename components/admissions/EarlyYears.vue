        <p>
          The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) in Blooms Academy sets
          standards for the learning development and care of children from 3
          months to 5 years. We run Montessori method of education which enables
          children to achieve their full potential.
        </p>

        <p>The EYFS programme is divided into four themes. These are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Unique Child</strong> – Each child is unique in his or her
            ability and our teachers understand the uniqueness of each child to
            plan the next step of learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Positive Relationship</strong> – Through positive
            relationship with peers and staff, our learners become strong and
            independent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enabling Environment</strong> – Our child-friendly
            facilities help in giving the children sense of belonging.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Learning and Development</strong> – We explore different
            methodologies in teaching ranging from role play, demonstration,
            songs and critical thinking to enable easy understanding of concept.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Our EYFS encourages every child to be independent, explore his or her
          environment and develop skills through flexible and inclusive
          learning. Our Sensorial Curriculum helps each child to focus on
          physical attributes as he or she explores variations in materials like
          height, width, weight, texture, temperature, shades of colour, sound
          and taste.
        </p>

        <p>
          Daily recording of learning of each child in the communication book
          shows the child’s progress performance which literally brings to life
          his or her experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Blooms Academy, we teach with passion and pupils learn through
          play.
